ðŸ“Œ RANDOMACCESSFILE â€” EXPLANATION
====================================================

ðŸ‘‰ What RandomAccessFile Does:
- Allows reading **and** writing to a file at **any position**.
- File pointer can be moved anywhere using `seek(position)`.
- Supports both **"r" (read-only)** and **"rw" (read/write)** modes.

ðŸ‘‰ Where We Use RandomAccessFile:
- When we need to **update part of a file** without rewriting the whole file.
- Database-like files where records are fixed-length and can be accessed by position.
- Editing large binary/text files at specific locations.
- Building custom file formats that need both read and write in random order.

ðŸ‘‰ Advantages:
1. **Read/Write anywhere** â€” move the pointer to any byte.
2. No need to load the whole file in memory.
3. Efficient for **large files** where only small parts need updating.
4. Supports both **binary** and **text** data.

ðŸ‘‰ Key Points:
- `seek(position)` moves file pointer to absolute byte position.
- `getFilePointer()` returns the current pointer position.
- `read()` reads a byte; `readChar()` reads 2 bytes (UTF-16).
- `write()` writes bytes/chars at current pointer position.
- **Caution:** Overwrites existing bytes at that position.
- Works best when file structure is known (fixed positions, offsets).

Example Concept:
File Content:   [ H  e  l  l  o  \n ]
Byte Index:      0  1  2  3  4   5
Pointer:
   seek(2) â†’ moves to 'l'
   write('X') â†’ file becomes [ H  e  X  l  o  \n ]
